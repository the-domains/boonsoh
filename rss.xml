            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Love of a Long Walk : zen habits</h1><p>Yesterday afternoon, I set off on a long walk. I'd been having an off day, tired from lots of activities and unmotivated and my mind fixated on one thing ... so I decided to walk. I put some snacks, a book, and some water in a backpack, put on some running shorts, a long-sleeve running shirt, some good shoes and a hat.</p></article>]]></description>
