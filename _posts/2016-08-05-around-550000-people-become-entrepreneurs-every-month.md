  The rate of new entrepreneurs in the United States has been steadily growing
  for two years, according to a new report. The Kauffman startup index found
  that the rate of new entrepreneurs -- or percent of non-business owning adults
  that started a business in a given month -- has gone up from 2014, when 280
  out of 100,000 adults became business owners, to 2016 when 330 out of 100,000
  did.
