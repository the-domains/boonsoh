  Yesterday afternoon, I set off on a long walk. I'd been having an off day,
  tired from lots of activities and unmotivated and my mind fixated on one thing
  ... so I decided to walk. I put some snacks, a book, and some water in a
  backpack, put on some running shorts, a long-sleeve running shirt, some good
  shoes and a hat.
