  Paul Coughlin had a long successful career on Wall Street and ran a private
  equity business, but after more than 30 years in the game, he was thirsty for
  something else. Literally. In 2013, he launched Taconic Distillery on the
  grounds of his Rolling Hills Farm in Stanfordville, N.Y., and has been making
  bourbon, rye, rum and maple syrup there ever since.
